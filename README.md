# MobApp

Mobile web application UI template kit based on Bootstrap 5

> This project is still in development and there will still be many changes in the structure and code.


## ðŸš€ Development Mode (Dev Mode)

To run the project in development mode, use PHP's built-in development server:

```sh
php -S localhost:8080 -t src/
```

This command will start a local server and serve files from the /src/ directory.
You can then access the project at `http://localhost:8080/`

## ðŸ“¦ Build Static Files

To export the project into static HTML files:

#### 1. Edit pages.txt

Add the paths of the PHP pages you want to build, one per line.
Example:

```bash
index.php
components/index.php
components/listview.php
components/buttons.php
```

#### 2. Run the build script

Execute the following command in the terminal:

```sh
php build.php
```

#### 3. Check the output

- The generated static files will be available in the /dist/ directory.
- PHP files will be converted into .html and all links inside will be updated automatically.
